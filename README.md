WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

A github repository was created for the project and cloned to my remote workspace. Initailly, an index.html, style.css, and relevant images were downloaded and kept in their correct folders. Stratign from scratch the structure to the webpage was built in index.html and with a linked styles.css file, the webpages was styled to make it presentable and accessible on computer screens through tablet screens to mobile phone screens.
